1. implement auto principal components chooser
2. take choose_PCA_components outside for loop in ExplorationAndEncoding_pt1
3. apply it only on the multiclass training sets and run it only with a sample of the data
4. when carrying out pca and FAMD, only fit on the training sets
5. adjust code so dataframes are saved containing pca, famd, famd + clustering. run this code.
6. add/edit paths to new dataframes of pca in kernel comparison
7. use the new dataframes in kernel comparison
8. add new pca datasets to ensemble (if needed)
8. run pure svm and ensemble learning svm


if needed: implement a method you pass to it an index and it searches a list of saved training model objections for a model and prints stats for that model. Then plot the conf matrix for this model.
